 * per model and computes which level to restore on switch.
 *
 * Attribution relies on pi's event ordering: setModel/cycle swap the model
 * and re-clamp the level (emitting thinking_level_select) *before* emitting
 * model_select. So when a thinking_level_select arrives whose current model
 * no longer matches the tracked active model, the change belongs to a switch:
 * previousLevel is the final level of the model being left (recorded), while
